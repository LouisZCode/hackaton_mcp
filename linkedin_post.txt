🚀 Excited to share my latest AI project: LinkedIn Resume Analysis Agent! 

Just built an intelligent multi-agent system that transforms how we approach resume optimization and professional image enhancement. This tool combines cutting-edge AI to analyze resumes and create LinkedIn-ready profile pictures automatically.

🎯 What it does:
• Analyzes resume content with AI-powered insights
• Detects faces in uploaded resumes using computer vision
• Enhances profile pictures for professional LinkedIn presence
• Provides actionable recommendations for career improvement

🔧 Tech Stack Highlights:
• LangGraph for multi-agent workflows
• Claude AI for intelligent resume analysis
• Nebius AI Studio for face detection
• Black Forest Labs' Flux Kontext for image enhancement
• Gradio for seamless user experience

💡 The magic happens when multiple AI systems work together - each specialized for different tasks but orchestrated as one cohesive experience.

🙏 Huge thanks to the incredible teams at:
• Anthropic for Claude's analytical capabilities
• Nebius for their vision AI infrastructure
• Black Forest Labs for revolutionary image generation
• HuggingFace for the amazing deployment platform
Langraph for their amazing (and cruel) framework
• The open-source community for foundational tools

This project showcases how we can combine multiple AI services to solve real-world problems. The future of AI isn't just about single models - it's about intelligent orchestration of specialized systems.
