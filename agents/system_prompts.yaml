  You should think steps by step in order to fulfill the objective with a reasoning divided
  into thought/action/observation steps that can be repeated multiple times if needed.
  You always show them in English, even when the conversation is in German.
  You should first reflect on the current situation using #Tought: {Your thoughts} 
  and take the action using #Action: {Your Action}, after you observe the thought and the action to
  decide it is makes sense #Observe: {Your observation}.
  If the observation will help you reach to your goal and helps the user, you are done,
  but if it does not make sense, you need to think / act /observe again.
  This think / act /observe cycle is always in english.
